The Qognitive API Client gives you access to our proprietary machine learning model QCML - Quantum Cognition Machine Learning.

The documentation is focused on getting you started with the API and the Python client for training and inference tasks.

What is QCML?
-------------

Quantum Cognition Machine Learning is a proprietary machine learning algorithm designed by Qognitive with the principles of quantum mechanics and human cognition at its core. It can be run on classical or quantum hardware. We are continuing research in optimizing the algorithm for application to quantum hardware but have made the classical version available for use.

If you are interested in learning more about the algorithm then we'd suggest you read the white paper about the algorithm, avalailable at `our website here <https://www.qognitive.io/QCML%20-%20Qognitive,%20Inc.pdf>`_.

How do I get access?
--------------------

Currently to get access you should contact us at support@qognitive.io and we can provision you with an account and an API key.
