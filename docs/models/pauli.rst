Pauli QCML
==========

The Pauli QCML model uses tensor products of Pauli matrices in order to build a quantum representation of the problem. For the Pauli QCML model the most important parameters are the ``qbits`` and the ``pauli_weight``. You can read about the function of these parameters below, they get passed when ``qcml.pauli(...)`` is called.
