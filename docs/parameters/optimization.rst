Optimization Parameters
=======================

The optimization parameters are used to control how our model finds the best internal representation of the problem space. These parameters are used only for training the model and do not affect the model's predictions (since the model is fixed after training).

There are several different methods of optimization that we currently support, each one with its own set of parameters.
