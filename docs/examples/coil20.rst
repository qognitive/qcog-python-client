COIL20
======

COIL20 (Columbia Object Image LIbrary - 20) is a dataset involving 20 images that are black and white and each have 72 pictures of each object taken at different angles. The dataset is available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-20.php

We will build a QCML model that will train on COIL20 and then classify the images.
